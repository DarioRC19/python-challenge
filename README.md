module 3


This file contains module 3 challenge, which is a simple code that reads a csv file and prints out the information that is requested from those files. After getting the result a text file is created in the analysis folder which also has the same results that would appear in the CMD. Instructor Bill helped out with the Pybank by setting up examples that I used to as reference when creating the code as well as giving ideas on how to attack the Pypoll problem.
